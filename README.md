This work come from the purpose of learning more advanced stuff of game programming
like opengl/shaders and other topics.
My intention is not to create next gen 3d engine but just having something of the box that
can be use to create simple 3d scenes.
I already implement 3d collisions and response with ellipsoid, point,spot and ambient lighting ,
shadow mapping ,HeightMap,Landscape , Terrain LodGeo, 
Octree and Quadtree space partition, ms3d, b3d,bsp, md3 and md2 mesh loading and animations with bones and vertex .

I've created a simple website with my google drive to show this demos.
